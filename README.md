The document is a detailed report focusing on the discovery and analysis of SQL Injection (SQLi) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities pose significant security risks, allowing attackers to manipulate database queries and inject malicious scripts into web applications. 

The report outlines the steps taken to identify these issues, using a specialized tool that was employed to uncover the vulnerabilities. 

Unfortunately, the original code used in this discovery process was lost, but all relevant information, including the methodology and key details of the code, is thoroughly documented within the report itself.
